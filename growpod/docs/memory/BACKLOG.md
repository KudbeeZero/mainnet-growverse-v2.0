# Backlog (Layer 3) — single source of priority

Status: `⬜ todo · 🔨 doing · ✅ done · ❄️ parked`. Standups may *propose* items; they're only real
once they appear here. Last reconciled: **2026-07-02** (REC-005 owner to-do sweep).

> **Reconciliation note (REC-004, 2026-06-14):** the Graphics Phase + Dashboard wiring are done and
> signed off; the studio is on the **New-Player / Launch-Readiness** track below. The full ledger of
> PRs / branches / directives + the launch critical path + department status live in
> `docs/memory/CANONICAL_STATE.md`.

## 🏛️ HERMES University + hardening (ACTIVE track — owner directive 2026-07-02)
> The university keeps its systems (no overhaul) but becomes **HERMES University for cannabis** — an
> online school with produced-once lessons. Plus the security-review follow-ups (PR #104) and the
> grow-room procedural-visual track (photoreal-in-pod reverted; see DECISIONS.md 2026-07-02).
- 🏛️ ✅ **Difficulty selector removed** (2026-07-02) — the Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced picker at the
  bottom of the course page is gone; every student attends one canonical delivery per course
  (`web/src/app/university/courses/[key]/page.tsx`). Backend `level` param stays tolerant (defaults).
- 🏛️ ✅ **Online-school catalog restyle** (2026-07-02) — HERMES branding on all university eyebrows,
  degree-progress strip, department "School of …" sections, credits on course cards
  (`web/src/app/university/page.tsx`). No data-model changes.
- 🏛️ 🔨 **University wiring audit** — end-to-end trace (curriculum → skills → learner model → agents →
  exams → web). Owner suspects mis-wiring; findings + fixes land in the HERMES memory doc.
- 🏛️ 🔨 **Produce-once lesson audio (ElevenLabs)** — lectures must be produced once and saved, never
  re-billed per delivery. Today `/lecture` can mint a fresh AI lecture *and* fresh TTS per attend
  (content-hash keyed); the produced-once path exists only on `/university/courses/<key>/audio`.
  Unify on produce-once; `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` stays host-secret-only (never in chat/repo).
- 🏛️ ⬜ **HERMES memory layer** — `docs/memory/design/HERMES_UNIVERSITY.md`: identity, layer map,
  wiring truths, lesson-production pipeline, open work (this session starts it).
- 🔴 ⬜ **Security follow-ups from PR #104** (before public launch): settlement **deposit** redesign
  (player-signed + indexer-verified inbound transfer) + **withdraw idempotency key** (treasury; owner
  gate); web CSP nonce (drop `'unsafe-inline'`) + move the player key off `localStorage`; TS api-server
  CORS allowlist; client-supplied `blockHash` / time-seeded `storyEngine` RNG hardening; add the
  missing `snapshot.yml` backup workflow (or correct SECURITY.md); enforce CODEOWNERS on protected
  surfaces; replace post-merge `drizzle-kit push` with generated migrations; delete the stale nested
  `growpod/artifacts/api-server` copy; dev-bypass explicit opt-in for previews.
- 🏛️ ⬜ **Global Learning Memory + personalization (design/11, owner directive 2026-07-02)** —
  P1 `knowledge_events` capture (append-only, anonymized-on-read, single-writer) at the 4
  generative call sites; P2 admissions persistence + `personal_context` into lecture/Master
  Grower; P3 `search_global_knowledge` retrieval tool (the teacher gets smarter from every
  player); P4 `global_insights` rollups + class-stats surface. Spec:
  `docs/memory/design/11-global-learning-memory.md`.
- 🎨 🔨 **3D whole-plant asset (PlantGL) — owner spec 2026-07-02, pilot Blue Dream** — layered
  R3F mesh system per the owner's 7-layer brief + 3 reference images: stem spline w/ nodes,
  curved branch skeleton, instanced serrated fan leaves, colas from clustered calyx meshes
  (reuses `web/src/lib/chamber/bud3d/` buildCola/buildFrost/buildPistils), sugar leaves,
  curled orange pistils, instanced trichome frost; PBR materials, LOD (close/mid/far),
  deterministic from authored strain DNA. Lands standalone at `/dev/plant3d` (studio-gray
  preview) for owner review; pod wiring AFTER approval. Supersedes the 2026-06-25 ADR note
  that the whole plant "intentionally stays 2D" (owner directive). Build in flight.
- 🕹️ ⬜ **Arcade layer on the plant sim (owner spec 2026-07-02)** — six skill-based, NON-GAMBLING,
  educational mini-games layered over the photorealistic plant core, affecting COSMETIC visuals +
  separate arcade scores only (never sim truth/economy/genetics — server stays authoritative):
  **Trichome Rush** (collect trichome targets → Resin Combo → frost visuals), **Lightwave Rhythm**
  (timing zones on light pulses → photosynthesis score), **Terpene Combo** (collect terpene orbs —
  myrcene/limonene/pinene/caryophyllene/linalool/humulene → plant aura/profile), **Cola Builder**
  (assemble stem/nodes/bracts/sugar leaves/pistils/trichomes → structure score), **Pest Invader**
  (defend vs stylized pests), **Mutation Events** (earned cosmetic traits: Blue Frost, Golden
  Pistils, Diamond Trichomes, Dense Cola Stack, Terpene Aura). Optional Algorand proof receipts
  for completed challenges (existing client SIMULATE layer is the start). Builds ON the existing
  arcade foundation (`web/src/lib/arcade/`, PR #100) + the PlantGL 3D asset. Recon report on the
  control panel layout + arcade inventory in flight (2026-07-02); design doc next; build after
  owner approves the design.
- 🕹️ ⬜ **Arcade layer on the 3D plant sim (owner spec 2026-07-02)** — fast, replayable,
  skill-based, NON-GAMBLING, educational mini-games layered OVER the scientific sim (core sim
  stays server-authoritative; arcade touches COSMETIC visuals + separate arcade scores ONLY —
  never health/economy/genetics truth). Six games: **Trichome Rush** (collect trichome targets
  → Resin Combo → frost visuals), **Lightwave Rhythm** (timing zones on moving light pulses →
  photosynthesis score), **Terpene Combo** (collect myrcene/limonene/pinene/caryophyllene/
  linalool/humulene orbs → plant aura/profile), **Cola Builder** (assemble stem/nodes/bracts/
  sugar leaves/pistils/trichomes → structure score; hooks the new plant3d 7-layer asset),
  **Pest Invader** (defend vs stylized pest/stress icons), **Mutation Events** (earned COSMETIC
  unlocks: Blue Frost, Golden Pistils, Diamond Trichomes, Dense Cola Stack, Terpene Aura).
  Updates local plant visuals + generates challenge scores; OPTIONAL Algorand proof receipts
  for completed challenges (reuses the PR #100 client SIMULATE layer). Builds on the existing
  arcade foundation (`web/src/lib/arcade/` boostEngine/timeRewind) — extend, don't duplicate.
  Prereq: recon report (control-panel layout + arcade inventory) → design doc → owner approval
  → build. Depends on the plant3d asset for Cola Builder + cosmetic mutation overrides.
- 🎨 ⬜ **Per-strain procedural fidelity pass** — `GrowChamber`/`BudGL` morphology + bud shape/color
  coverage across all 29 strains (the follow-up track from the 2026-07-02 revert ADR).

### 🕵️ Dormant investments (2026-07-02 sweep — built but unused; owner picks wire-in vs retire)
> Full evidence (file:line per item) in the sweep report attached to PR #104. "Staged, not dead"
> items (HeyGen presenter, `/mission`, Clone Room TS stack, boost-economy docs, WO-1/WO-2) are
> deliberately parked and NOT listed here.
- 🔴 ⬜ **5 of 12 feature flags gate nothing** — `ftue_tutorial`, `grow_chamber`,
  `master_grower_advisor`, `breeding_lab`, `daily_stipend` (`data/balance.yaml` `feature_flags:`)
  have zero `require_feature` call sites: flipping them off does nothing. False kill switches are
  worse than none — decorate the FTUE/breeding/advisor/stipend routes. **Protected surface (flags):
  needs owner OK.**
- 🔴 ⬜ **Web gating never reads `GET /api/game/flags`** — `web/src/lib/features.ts` is env-var-driven
  default-ON; the planned re-point (DECISIONS 2026-06-14 "Web Gating PR") never landed, so backend
  kill switches don't reach the web UI. Land the re-point.
- 🟠 ⬜ **Wire in: finished backends one UI hop from paying off** — `POST .../plants/<id>/apply`
  (consumables; store sells them but has no "use item"), `GET /strains/<id>/effects` (effects panel),
  admissions department/track recommendation (persist + surface; HERMES open-work #2),
  `Player.last_active_at` (exactly what WO-2 "welcome-back delta" needs), `/contracts` page
  (whole built surface with no nav entry — one `navLinks.ts` line).
- 🟠 ⬜ **Retire: superseded/dead web code** — `components/intro/` (4 files; superseded by FTUE),
  `components/pod/PodCard.tsx` + `EnvironmentForm`/`WeatherRoller` (superseded by Command Center),
  `command/CommandTopBar.tsx`/`CommandFooter.tsx` (+ stranded `hooks/useLiveClock.ts`, cosmetics
  exports), `lib/timeControls.ts`, backend `serve_narration` route (superseded by produce-once
  audio). Owner-taste call: `onboarding/VideoHero.tsx` + `public/media/*` (revive on landing or
  retire).
- 🟡 ⬜ **Retire: stale infra** — `growpod/artifacts/*` nested duplicates (confirmed stale vs root),
  `scripts/build-production.sh` + `start-production.sh` (describe a deploy that doesn't exist),
  `scripts/src/hello.ts` scaffolds, `attached_assets/` dumps, empty `growpod/lib/db` schema stub.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Dead DB columns** — `ResearchProgress.unlocked_at`, `GrowthMeasurement.leaf_count`/
  `growth_rate` (drop migration when convenient); `Player.last_active_at` is the wire-in above.
  `INDEXER_URL` is read but unconsumed — it's needed by the settlement-deposit redesign; keep.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Docs hygiene tail (2026-07-02 MD sweep)** — remaining from `docs/memory/DOCS_INDEX.md`:
  resume or tombstone `BUILDLOG.md`; restamp the frozen "Live" ledgers (`CANONICAL_STATE.md`,
  `STUDIO_AGENT_REGISTRY.md`, `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_LEDGER.md`) as dated snapshots or refresh;
  retire `docs/DEV_BUILD_LOG.md` (Replit-era); archive-or-refresh the `docs/00–09` numbered
  snapshots; merge the two DATABASE_SYSTEMS_AUDIT copies; consider a HANDOFF staleness gate in
  `check_memory.py` like the backlog's.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Simplify: unreachable AI-factory branches** — master-grower/admissions/roadmap "real
  provider" arms always return the mock (classes don't exist); build the Claude providers or
  simplify the guards. (HeyGen arm stays — owner-gated spend.)

## 🚀 New-Player / Launch-Readiness (ACTIVE track — onboarding → MVP launch)
> Player-facing, additive work on existing rails toward a launchable MVP — **no economy / chain /
> breeding / factions / combat / new crop families, no new Phase-2 systems.** Off-chain MVP first.
- 🚀 ✅ **FTUE Epic — guided first grow** (merged 2026-06-14) — **PR #34** starter-grant rail
  (one-shot/idempotent via `grant_claims` unique index, migration `c7ecd7523cc8`), **PR #35** tutorial
  backend (`services/ftue_service.py` — a guarded deterministic step machine on `Player.ftue_step`,
  per-step scripted AI Master Grower coaching `ai/ftue_coach.py`, tutorial-only time-compression,
  `/ftue` endpoints, migration `9d669edf48a8`), **PR #39** web `/ftue` guided route. New signups walk
  plant → water → climate → grow → harvest → "come back tomorrow". ADR in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-14);
  5 FTUE tests in `tests/test_ftue.py`.
- 🚀 ✅ **Launch Strain Integration Pack** (PR #33, merged 2026-06-13) — White Rhino, White Fire OG,
  Gelato, Wedding Cake added to `data/strains.yaml` + `data/strain_knowledge.yaml` (catalog now
  **29 strains**, 1:1 KB sync test green) with authored chamber visuals + per-strain physics knobs.
- 🚀 ✅ **Mobile-first navigation** (PR #36, merged 2026-06-14) — native bottom tab bar (primary +
  "More" sheet), `env(safe-area-inset-*)` handling, focus-visible rings, thumb-zone CTA targets
  (≥44px), responsive Grow Chamber. ADR in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-14). (PR #40's competing bottom-nav
  was retired — FP-1 superseded by #36; see `docs/STUDIO_AGENT_REGISTRY.md` collision log.)
- 🚀 ✅ **DX-001 Care Feedback & Celebration** (PR #41, merged 2026-06-14) — rewarding care actions +
  a harvest moment (`web/src/components/plant/CareFeedback.tsx`, `web/src/components/plant/careFeedback.ts`,
  `web/src/lib/haptics.ts`, `web/src/hooks/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts`); reduced-motion safe. Addresses
  #37's FP-5/FP-9 friction.
- 🚀 ✅ **FP-3 Primary Plant CTA** (PR #45, "DIR-004", merged 2026-06-14) — the next action is always
  visually primary on the dashboard for a new grower (`web/src/lib/plantAction.ts`,
  `web/src/components/plant/PlantActionCTA.tsx`). The re-cut of #37's FP-3.
- 🚀 ⬜ **Salvaged from PR #37 (Grow Guide, closed)** — backend work orders the closed coach needed,
  not yet built: **WO-1** per-action "last cared at" / care-acknowledged signals (so a tutorial can
  gate discrete Water/Feed/Check steps without guessing from decaying levels); **WO-2** a lightweight
  "session delta / welcome-back" endpoint (what changed since last seen — stage advances, new buds,
  frost) to power a return-moment. Both are backend (WO-gated); design only until approved.
- 🚀 ✅ **Feature Flags** (PR #42, landed 2026-06-14) — data-driven MVP launch gate: non-MVP systems
  (marketplace, on-chain `chain`, Cup, University, contracts) gated **OFF by default**. Backend
  `config.Settings` `ENABLE_*` → `app.config["FEATURE_*"]` enforced by a `require_feature` decorator
  (`api/feature_gates.py`) applied **above** `require_player` (gated route → **404 before auth**). Web
  mirrors via `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_*` (`web/src/lib/features.ts`): feature-gating lives in the shared
  `web/src/components/layout/navLinks.ts` so **both** the desktop `NavBar` and the mobile `MobileTabBar`
  hide gated entries, plus `RequireFeature` route guards and in-page hides. Tests:
  `tests/test_feature_gates.py`, `web/src/lib/__tests__/features.test.ts`. ADR in `DECISIONS.md`
  (2026-06-14).
- 🚀 🔨 **Playtesting → Retention Validation → MVP Launch Candidate** — the launch critical-path tail.
  Testing-prep (2026-06-18): `make testenv` stands up the full stack behind a cloudflared tunnel with
  a dev/test-only **skip-login** shortcut (`NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_BYPASS`, default OFF) + dev clock,
  plus `docs/TESTER_RUNBOOK.md` + a bug-report template. Economy is in deliberate **free testing mode**
  (free seeds, boosted stipend); launch values are guarded by `tests/fixtures/launch_balance.yaml` +
  the `test_launch_balance_values` tripwire — **restore them in `balance.yaml` before launch.**
- 🚀 ❄️ **OMNI Charter v1.0** (PR #38, merged 2026-06-14) — organizational constitution
  (`docs/OMNI_CHARTER.md`): chain of command, departments, work-order system, canonical principles.
  Governance layer; no further backlog action.

- 🚀 ⬜ **Optional boost economy + UI feature package (planning, docs only)** — product/economy/UI
  planning for 10 UI lanes, an optional **free-in-alpha** paid boost/recovery concept, a
  liquidity-first transparency model, fairness guardrails, boost UI copy, and a build roadmap. Docs
  in `docs/product/` (`GROWVERSE_UI_FEATURE_BUILDS.md`, `GROWVERSE_OPTIONAL_BOOST_ECONOMY.md`,
  `GROWVERSE_LIQUIDITY_TRANSPARENCY_MODEL.md`, `GROWVERSE_FAIRNESS_GUARDRAILS.md`,
  `GROWVERSE_BOOST_UI_COPY.md`, `GROWVERSE_BUILD_PRIORITY_ROADMAP.md`); ADR in `DECISIONS.md`
  (2026-06-19). **No code / no economy change** — boosts are `planned`, free + QA-labeled in alpha;
  five owner decisions gate any real activation. Build only after the named owner decisions.
- 🚀 ⬜ **AI-assistance feature package (planning, docs only)** — 10 lanes for an AI bot the player
  can **ask for assistance** that **evaluates real grow state** and **gives correct, grounded
  assistance**, priced as an optional boost but **free + QA-labeled in alpha**. Grounded on the
  existing `live` advisor (`GET /players/<id>/plants/<id>/advisor`, `api/game_api.py:621` →
  `services/advisor_service.py` → swappable `ai/` providers) + `ai/autocare.py`. Doc:
  `docs/product/GROWVERSE_AI_ASSISTANCE_FEATURE_BUILDS.md`. **No code / no economy change** — every
  lane `planned`, assists post $0 ledger entries in alpha; moving off free is an owner stop-and-ask.
  Five owner design questions gate activation. Extends the boost-economy package above.

## 🎨 Graphics Phase II/III (COMPLETE — signed off 2026-06-14; no scope expansion)
> The game's emotional core is the whole-plant chamber view. This track is **visual-only** —
> no economy / chain / breeding / factions / combat / new crop families. Canon lives in
> `knowledge/` (botanical-bible, macro-bud-rules, whole-plant-architecture, strain-dna,
> environment-rules, procedural-generation). The macro bud system is launch-ready; the whole-plant
> system foundation is complete. **PR numbering shifted mid-phase** (PRs #27 Phenotype + #28
> Circadian were opened by a parallel session), so Canonical Stage PNG is #29 and Dashboard wiring
> is now #30 — see entries below.
- 🎨 ✅ **PR #25 — De-Grape Whole Plant Buds** (merged 2026-06-14) — chamber flower sites paint a
  continuous bud-mass silhouette behind the calyxes so they read as stacked colas, not loose
  circles. ADR in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-13). Owner visual sign-off 2026-06-14 (canonical stills).
- 🎨 ✅ **PR #26 — Bud Weight Physics Polish** (merged 2026-06-14, with #29) —
  `web/src/lib/chamber/budPhysics.ts`
  (`flowerStageMultiplier` / `branchFlex` / `branchDroop` ≤12° / `colaLean` ≤5° / `airflowWeighting`)
  + per-strain `branchStrength`/`budWeightMul` knobs; droop applied as branch rotation, bud mass
  folded into the airflow wave. G13 upright/strong · PDP heavy/sagging · Animal Mints balanced.
  Owner visual sign-off 2026-06-14.
- 🎨 ✅ **PR #29 — Canonical Stage PNG Generation** (landed 2026-06-14, carried on #26's branch) —
  the chamber renderer was extracted verbatim into a framework-agnostic `web/src/lib/chamber/chamberCore.ts`
  (single source for the live component + a headless generator); `web/scripts/gen-stage-pngs.ts`
  (`npm run gen:stages`) renders the curated strains × stage matrix to PNG via `@napi-rs/canvas`
  (output `web/canonical-stages/`, gitignored). De-grape ported into `chamberCore` on merge.
- 🎨 ✅ **Phyllotaxy & Pseudo-3-D Depth — Engines 3 & 4** (branch `claude/cannabis-growth-engine-s114yu`,
  2026-06-14) — the whole-plant skeleton now winds nodes around the stem by a real azimuth (decussate
  base → 137.5° golden spiral apex) instead of flat left/right alternation, projected to pseudo-3-D
  (foreshortening + front/back depth + back→front paint order + atmospheric shade) with per-node leaf
  **yaw** so fans no longer all billboard at the camera, and a per-plant phase so no two plants align.
  New pure module `web/src/lib/chamber/phyllotaxy.ts` (+ tests, maturity-0 ≡ legacy alternation);
  `chamberCore` integration only. Silhouettes preserved (verified across the 7-strain × stage PNG
  matrix). ADR `DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-14. **Device sign-off pending** (owner to view the chamber).
- 🎨 ✅ **Apical Dominance / Multi-Cola — Engines 1 & 2** (PR #58, 2026-06-14) — strains now grow one
  dominant cola (spear: G13, White Fire OG) *or* several competing upright tops (bush: Purple Diddy
  Punch, White Rhino) from a new `Silhouette.apicalDominance` knob. New pure `apicalDominance.ts`
  (`colaTops`, mass-conserving, +tests); `chamberCore` promotes the top nodes into co-colas in flower
  only (single-cola + veg paths unchanged). ADR `DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-14. **Device sign-off pending.**
- 🎨 ⬜ **PR #27 — Phenotype Generator Foundation** — *PARKED* (open PR, green). Do not modify.
- 🎨 ⬜ **PR #28 — Circadian Leaf Motion** — *PARKED* (open PR, green). Do not modify. *Note: the
  per-node branch azimuth now available on `Node` (Engines 3&4, PR #58) is the natural input for
  light-seeking pitch + circadian droop when #28 lands.*
- 🎨 ✅ **PR #29/#30 — Dashboard / GameState Wiring Polish** (merged 2026-06-14) — consumption polish
  on the flat `GET …/plants/<id>/state` wire (it stays canonical; no aggregate `GameState` object —
  see `DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-14). Added a global `AuthErrorListener` (401/403 → session teardown,
  clears prior RISK #10) and `usePods` refresh-on-interval/focus.
- MVP Launch Candidate now lives on the 🚀 New-Player / Launch-Readiness track above (after Feature
  Flags → Mobile Polish → Playtesting → Retention Validation).
- 🎨 ⬜ **Macro Bud Polish II** (future; *not launch-blocking*) — sharper calyx ridges, denser calyx
  nesting, reduce the smooth-oval appearance on the Purple Diddy Punch *macro* bud, improve chunky
  calyx definition. Macro ("Detailed Bud View") only — the whole-plant chamber is signed off.

## 🚀 Launch-Readiness path (Builder Dept — STEP sequence)
> Feature Flags → **STEP 3 Simulation Test Clock** → STEP 4 e2e Grow Loop → Launch Readiness.
- 🚀 ✅ **STEP 3 — Simulation Test Clock** (BE-002, 2026-06-14) — dev/test-only `OffsetClock` on the
  existing compute-on-read seam: `/api/dev/clock/{,advance,reset}`, registered only when
  `GROW_TEST_CLOCK=true` on a non-production `APP_ENV` (force-disabled in prod). Advancing time posts
  **no ledger entries** (economy untouched), forward-only, capped at 8760h. ADR in `DECISIONS.md`
  (2026-06-14); usage in `docs/SIMULATION_TEST_CLOCK.md`; `tests/test_test_clock.py` (15).
- 🚀 ✅ **STEP 4 — e2e Grow Loop** (BE-004, 2026-06-14) — seed → plant → grow → flower → harvest →
  sell driven over the HTTP API and fast-forwarded with the STEP 3 dev clock
  (`tests/test_e2e_grow_loop.py`, 3). Ledger integrity proven (advancing time posts no entries).
  HTTP-boundary coverage for the value-bearing routes — withdraw/deposit/mint/nft — landed
  (`tests/test_http_boundary.py`, 13), partially closing RISK #8 (backend side). Report:
  `docs/STEP4_E2E_GROW_LOOP_VALIDATION.md`. Suite 262 green, 83.6% ≥ 79%. **Test-only, no source.**
- 🚀 ⬜ **STEP 4.5 — GameService on `active_clock()` + cure/auction e2e** (next; owner-approved
  2026-06-14) — one-line change (`game_service.py:82`, mirroring STEP 3) so the dev clock also
  fast-forwards harvest/**cure**/sell + auction expiry over HTTP, then extend the e2e loop to the
  cure step. Prod-behaviour identical (`active_clock()` → `SystemClock` in prod). See Risk #1 in the
  STEP 4 report.

## 🔴 Immediate (do now — correctness, truth, or unblocks others)
- 🔴 🔨 **Concurrency + idempotency hardening** (RISK #6) — *core landed 2026-06-10*: wallet
  optimistic locking (`version_id_col`) + `CHECK(cached_balance >= 0)` + harvest-once unique index
  (migration `f1a2b3c4d5e6`) + 409-on-conflict + the F5 flaky-limiter-test fix. +4 concurrency
  tests (189 total). Closes double-spend / double-harvest / negative-balance at the DB level.
  *Remaining (⬜): general `Idempotency-Key` header (duplicate → original response, not a 409) and
  one-shot-grant uniqueness (daily stipend, achievements).* See `DECISIONS.md` 2026-06-10 +
  `docs/audits/2026-06-10-fleet-sweep.md`.
- 🔴 ⬜ **Chain settlement verification** (RISK #7) — deposit must verify an on-chain txid
  (confirmed, asset-id, receiver=treasury, sender=linked addr, amount); txid replay protection
  (unique `onchain_txid`); reconciliation job; address validation/opt-in on link/withdraw. Blocks
  any real value moving (Sprint 4 gate).
- 🔴 ✅ **Restore the web safety net** (RISK #8, 2026-06-18) — `web/package.json` test scripts
  un-stubbed (`vitest run` / `playwright test`), `vitest` + `@playwright/test` added to devDeps, and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` web job now runs vitest **and** a Playwright e2e step (`npm install`
  since the lockfile can't be regenerated offline — switch back to `npm ci` once it's regenerated
  with network). Re-exported `computeFeatures` (was commented out in testing mode) so the existing
  features unit test passes. HTTP-boundary withdraw/deposit/mint (PR #47) + global 401/403 handler
  (PR #29/#30) were already done. *Validation pending the first CI run (no web npm network locally).*
- 🔴 ✅ **Make the integrity/CI gates REAL** (2026-06-10) — a chat found that
  `scripts/check_memory.py`, `scripts/check_single_head.py`, the SessionStart hook, **and
  the CI workflow did not exist on disk** (it was later built, and on 2026-06-18 relocated to the
  repository root so GitHub actually runs it), despite being claimed ✅ below and in
  `CLAUDE.md`/`MAP.md`. Built all four for real and verified locally: `make check-memory`,
  `make check-migrations`, `make lint`, and `make test` (**182 passed, 79.1% ≥ 78 gate**) all
  green; the two checkers carry a teeth-test. The four stale entries below are annotated. Also
  installed the **Session Relay Protocol** (`docs/SESSION_PROTOCOL.md` + `docs/HANDOFF.md`
  baton + `docs/audits/`). See standup `2026-06-10-lut-report.md`.
- ✅ Add `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/memory/` memory-layer system (this change).
- 🔴 ⬜ **Reconcile `docs/ROADMAP.md` with reality** — Sprints 1–3 are shipped but still show
  ⬜/🔨. Planning is reading a map that lies. *(partially fixed 2026-06-08; verify exit criteria)*
- 🔴 ⬜ **Retire/replace `docs/NEXT_SESSION_SPRINT3.md`** — Sprint 3 is done; the handoff is stale.
- 🔴 ⬜ **Fix `BUILDLOG.md` header** referencing the old trunk branch
  `claude/cannabis-game-lut-economics-utfiK`. *(fixed 2026-06-08 — keep an eye on drift)*
- ✅ **Repair the dev env install** (2026-06-08) — added `Makefile` (`make setup` = venv-based
  install, sidesteps the system-PyYAML collision), a `pyproject.toml` build backend so
  `pip install -e .` uses PEP 660 (no more legacy `install_layout` crash), and a
  `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` SessionStart hook so web sessions install deps automatically
  (sets `PYTHONPATH=src`, mirroring CI). Validated: hook exit 0, `make setup && make test` →
  139 passed. *(⚠️ Drift corrected 2026-06-10: the hook file was actually absent on disk; it
  was built for real this session and now fires — see the Immediate entry above.)*

- 🔴 ✅ **Memory-integrity gate** (2026-06-08) — `scripts/check_memory.py` + `make check-memory` +
  a CI step fail on broken internal links, ✅ claims citing missing paths, or a codex that drifts out
  of the layer map. Plus a master `docs/memory/MAP.md` (layer map + code↔doc index + moat dashboard);
  ARCHITECTURE invariant #9 + two DECISIONS entries (Phase A, provable fairness) reconcile the layers
  with this session's code. *(Partly delivers the "docs-drift check" from the 2026-06-08 standup §4A.)*
  *(⚠️ Drift corrected 2026-06-10: `scripts/check_memory.py` was absent on disk; built for real
  + teeth-tested this session.)*

## 🟠 Medium (next 1–2 weeks — quality & the next real capability)
- 🟠 ✅ **CI coverage gate** (2026-06-08) — `pytest --cov` with a ratchet floor (`pyproject.toml`
  `fail_under=78`, ops scripts omitted), wired into `make test` + CI. Completes the "make truth
  automatic" trio (lint + memory-integrity + coverage). *Ratchet the floor up as coverage climbs.*
  *(⚠️ Drift corrected 2026-06-10: the coverage gate works in `make test`, but the claimed CI did
  not exist — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was built for real this session.)*
- 🟠 ⬜ **Sprint 4: real TestNet + IPFS** — fund treasury, run `reset_asa`, wire `ASA_ID`; move NFT
  metadata to IPFS; add a DB↔chain reconciliation job + `onchain_txid` audit.
- 🟠 ✅ **Sim cost cap** (2026-06-10) — compute-on-read is bounded: one catch-up simulates at most
  `max_catchup_hours`, then the plant goes **dormant** through the rest of the gap (stage clock
  pauses; auditable `dormancy` event) and lands at `now` — one cap window once ever per derelict
  plant (311 ms → 0.1 ms on the next read), near-term reads bit-identical (parity-tested). +3 tests
  (185 total). ADR in `DECISIONS.md`. *Remaining (⬜): background materialization for bursts of
  first-reads at scale.*
- 🟠 ⬜ **Idempotency keys on mutations** — protect ledger/economy from double-submits & retries.
- 🟠 ⬜ **Anti-bot / fair-play framework (spec)** (owner request, 2026-06-11) — defense-in-depth
  against automation farming the faucets, layered so honest players never feel it:
  (1) **humanity gates** — lightweight proof-of-humanity challenges only at high-value moments
  (claim/mint/withdraw), never on the core grow loop; (2) **behavioral telemetry** — server-side
  cadence/entropy scoring per player (inter-action timing distributions, diurnal rhythm, input
  variety) — signals only, never auto-ban; (3) **diminishing-returns penalty** — per-day soft caps
  that taper faucet yield under inhuman cadence instead of hard-blocking; (4) **Sybil costs** —
  new-account faucet throttle + earned-trust curve before faucets open fully, scaled by
  IP/ASN/device-cluster reputation; (5) **shadow-penalties** — flagged accounts keep playing but
  faucet earnings land in a quarantined ledger pending review, so botters get no oracle;
  (6) **human-in-the-loop gate** — no permanent penalty without manual review + an appeals path;
  (7) **Adversarial Twin** — a sanctioned in-repo bot harness that plays the live rules to find
  profitable automation before players do (red-team CI for the economy). Composes with the
  time+skill anti-bot moat per `docs/memory/design/03-grower-skills.md` and the no-dark-patterns
  charter per `docs/memory/design/04-honesty-and-trust.md`. **Spec logged; build on owner
  green-light.**
- 🟠 ⬜ **Load/soak test the `/state` catch-up path** to find the cost knee before players do.
- 🟠 ⬜ **Web e2e smoke** (Playwright) over the full loop; today web CI is lint/typecheck/build only.
- 🟠 ✅ **Sim depth — Phase A (derive VPD + DLI; wire the stored light scalar into the tick).** Done
  2026-06-08: `simulation/horticulture.py` (VPD/DLI/SVP), light + VPD health terms in `engine.py`
  (tuned in `balance.yaml`), VPD/DLI/PPFD exposed on `/state`. +8 tests (147 total, green). *Next:*
  Phase B (photosynthesis + transpiration + EC/pH→uptake) — land the sim-cost-cap first.

## 🟡 Low / later (valuable, not urgent)
- 🟡 ⬜ **Constellation leaf-mesh follow-ups (sacred-hash re-pin batch)** (helper review,
  2026-06-11) — three deferred items that each require intentionally changing a pinned render
  function in `web/src/components/viz/Constellation.tsx` (update the sha256 pins in
  `constellationLifecycle.test.ts` in the same commit, per its header): (a) batch the leaf mesh
  edges into one path — in leaf mode `hovered` is never set so all ~900 edges share a style, but
  `draw()` strokes per-edge today (~913 extra canvas calls/frame at `leafCount=260`); (b) derive
  the mesh edge color from the `accent` prop (hard-coded green today — constrains non-default
  accents); (c) consider debouncing the wordmark resize re-seed (O(n²) mesh rebuild per 8px step;
  ~19ms desktop at 260). Net page cost already went *down* vs the old 620-particle hero — do this
  before any low-end-mobile push, not before launch.
- 🟡 ⬜ Sprint 6 LiveOps: seasonal strains rotation, timed events, breeding competitions, admin
  console with hot-reload `balance.yaml`, analytics/telemetry.
- 🟡 ⬜ Non-custodial Pera/WalletConnect path for player-owned NFTs.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Fiat payment rail (parked by owner, 2026-06-11)** — launch liquidity is bring-your-own
  ALGO; see the ADR in `DECISIONS.md` (2026-06-11). If/when revisited: Stripe Checkout Sessions
  (+ Billing for subscriptions), gated behind RISK #7 (real settlement) being closed, a matching
  sink for the new faucet, and an explicit owner green-light (charter: real money = stop-and-ask).
- 🟡 ⬜ Observability upgrade: logs → metrics → traces as traffic grows.
- 🟡 ⬜ Secrets management hardening before any real value (encrypt keys at rest / secrets manager).
- 🟡 ⬜ Age-gating/compliance + ToS/privacy review (simulated cannabis only).
- 🟡 ⬜ **Generative genetics** — polygenic genome + mutation/epistasis/G×E toward endless,
  *discovered* strains; genome fingerprint → on-chain GenBank + Proof-of-Cultivation (needs Sprint 4
  chain). Per `docs/memory/design/02-genetics.md`.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Grower-skill mastery** — use-based skill trees (effort/time → capability), distinct from the
  spend-based research tree; the equipment bridge. Per `docs/memory/design/03-grower-skills.md`.
- 🟡 🔨 **Trust layer** — provable fairness landed for breeding (`/strains/<id>/provenance`) and the
  whole pedigree (`/strains/<id>/lineage`, the GenBank's verifiable family tree). Remaining: generalize
  replay to sim/weather/discovery, a genome fingerprint, a public faucet-vs-sink economy view, advisor
  confidence/uncertainty surfacing, and a no-dark-patterns charter. Per `docs/memory/design/04-honesty-and-trust.md`.

- 🟡 ✅ **Strain knowledge base** (2026-06-08) — catalog grown 16→22 (iconic landraces/classics) +
  `data/strain_knowledge.yaml`, a scientist-grade encyclopedia (lineage, origin, cannabinoid/terpene
  detail, cultivation params) for every catalog strain, at public `GET /strains/<id>/knowledge`. A
  test enforces 1:1 catalog↔KB sync.
- 🟡 ✅ **Deep-research campaign** (2026-06-08) — `docs/research/2026-06-08-cannabis-strain-genetics-and-cultivation.md`:
  5-agent, peer-reviewed-prioritized reference on lineage, chemotype, cultivation, agronomy, and
  taxonomy/genetics. Reconciled into the KB (disputed-lineage flags + scientific caveats header).
- 🟡 ⬜ **KB enrichment pass (research-grounded)** — add a `terpene_cluster` per strain (myrcene /
  terpinolene / limonene-caryophyllene); model assayed THC as an inflation-biased distribution; wire
  the PPFD/DLI→yield relationship into the sim (Phase B). Per the research doc's §6 action items.
- 🟡 ✅ **Seasonal Cannabis Cup** (2026-06-08) — `services/cup_service.py` + `CannabisCup`/`CupEntry`
  models + migration `d5e6f7a8b9c0`: per-season competition, deterministic `cup_score`, lifetime
  champion rewards (one-of-a-kind legendary trophy strain + permanent title + Hall of Fame). Public
  `/cup/*` + authed enter; +9 tests. *Next (⬜): on-chain trophy NFT (Sprint 4), judged terpene-cluster
  categories, grower-reputation tie-in.* Per `docs/memory/design/05-events-and-competition.md`.
- 🟠 ✅ **CI: enforce a single Alembic head** (2026-06-08) — `scripts/check_single_head.py` (reads the
  migration graph via `ScriptDirectory`, fails with an actionable `alembic merge` hint on a fork),
  wired into `make check-migrations` + a CI step before `alembic upgrade head`. Catches the fork class
  of bug (e.g. the old `fbb8fceedacd` fork) automatically instead of by manual testing.
  *(⚠️ Drift corrected 2026-06-10: `scripts/check_single_head.py` was absent on disk; built for real
  + verified (single head `e7a9c1b3f2d8`) this session.)*
- 🟡 ✅ **GrowPod University** (2026-06-08) — `services/university_service.py` + `lecturer_service.py`
  + `data/curriculum.yaml` + `CourseEnrollment`/`DegreeProgress` + migration `e7a9c1b3f2d8`: enroll
  (tuition sink) → time + practical study → degrees (permanent perks via the research effect keys +
  a title + XP), taught by an AI Professor (mock for CI, Claude in prod). Public `/university/catalog`
  + authed enroll/complete/claim/lecture; +13 tests. Grounded in a cited curriculum research report.
  *Next (⬜): quizzes, more departments, Doctorate tier, diploma NFTs.* Per `docs/memory/design/06-university.md`.
- 🟡 ✅ **Web client — full UI build** (2026-06-08, branch `claude/growv2-web-ui-build-MZWZE`) — the
  Next 15 client now covers all seven screen groups (onboarding hero · grow dashboard with VPD/DLI/PPFD
  · strain lab + encyclopedia + DNA/lineage constellations + Verify provenance · GenBank galaxy ·
  market fixed/auctions/contracts · Cannabis Cup + Hall of Fame · University catalog/transcript/course
  + AI Professor lecture reader · Profile with lifetime titles). Centerpiece: dependency-free
  `web/src/components/viz/Constellation.tsx` (the genetic-constellation signature language). Green
  typecheck/lint/build + live-API contract smoke. Post-build cleanup: fixed a Constellation
  stale-deps bug (genome graphs reused locus ids across strains → now keyed on content + edges),
  hex-sanitized canvas colors + position clamp, retired `/account`+`/contracts` → redirects, and an
  a11y pass (Modal Escape/`role=dialog`, ARIA tabs, `aria-pressed` chips, input/select labels,
  reduced-motion). Follow-up pass: **constellation perf** (O(n²) repulsion → uniform spatial-hash
  grid, semantics preserved) and a **Vitest unit-test harness** (71 tests over `format.ts` +
  `graphAdapters.ts`, `pool: forks` for sandbox/CI robustness, wired into web CI). See standup
  `2026-06-08-lut-report-web-ui-build.md`.
- 🟠 ✅ **Web e2e smoke (Playwright)** (2026-06-08) — mocked-API Playwright suite (`web/e2e/`,
  `playwright.config.ts`) over onboarding + authed dashboard + university; `test:e2e` script + a CI
  `e2e` job. It immediately caught **two real browser-only bugs**, both fixed: (1) the CSP
  `script-src 'self'` blocked Next's inline hydration scripts so the app blanked in-browser — fixed
  by allowing `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts (sources still locked to self, eval still blocked);
  (2) the dashboard's Zustand selector returned a fresh `[]` each render → React #185 infinite loop
  that crashed the page for players with no locally-stored ids — fixed with a stable reference.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Education-gated Master Grower knowledge** (owner idea, 2026-06-08) — tie advisor depth +
  unlocks (tips/tricks, rare bio-DNA traits, breeding **pollen**, "DNA-in-the-seed") to University
  progress. Composes existing systems: degree perks (research effect keys) raise an advisor knowledge
  tier and unlock breeding consumables that bias the still-seeded, provably-fair cross. Needs a design
  doc + balance pass; no new infra.
- 🟡 ⬜ **Sponsored / branded content (revenue)** (owner idea, 2026-06-08) — real cannabis brands
  sponsoring cultivars, branded equipment/pods, and promotions, using the on-chain asset layer to
  sidestep traditional ad/banking restrictions. A "sponsored cultivar" is a GenBank entry with
  verifiable provenance + brand tag. Needs a partner/content model + a no-dark-patterns guardrail
  (ties into the trust layer charter). Business/LiveOps track.
